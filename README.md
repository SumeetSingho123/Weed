# Weed-Detection
This Problem is based on a Image Data set consisting of different types of weeds, to detect them in crops and fields. I have used Deep Learning Model called CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) with Dropout, Batch Normalization, ReduceLearning rate on plateau, Early stoppig rounds, and Transposd Convolutional Neural Networks.
